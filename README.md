# SmartCommute

# Project Idea (1-sentence): 
The project is designed to help the people to decide the transportation means to travel to their respective destination.

# What is the purpose, and most common use cases?
Purpose: This will help the person to save time and money to reach to a destination.

Common use case: 
1. In peek hours of the day, everyone wants to reach to their destination on time especially corporate people and students. This project will give them the suggestion to travel through a particular transportation means(bikes, train, cab).

2. This project will also help them decide the efficient means of transportation with the cheapest price and shortest travel time.

# Which technologies are well-suited to solve those challenges? (list all relevant)

I am using the dataset given by Citi Bike, a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving in New York, which can be accesssed using the following link:

For the cab dataset, I am using the following dataset link:

Since the data is real-time streaming, I am using following technologies:

1. Spark Streaming
2. Kafka
